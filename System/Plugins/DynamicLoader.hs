Load a module given its name (for instance @Data.FiniteMap@), maybe a
path to the base directory and maybe a file extension. If no such path
is given the current working directory is used and if no file suffix
is given \"o\" is used.

If we have our module hierarchy in @\/usr\/lib\/modules@ and we want to
load the module @Foo.Bar@ located in @\/usr\/lib\/modules\/Foo\/Bar.o@ we
could issue the command:

@loadModule \"Foo.Bar\" (Just \"\/usr\/lib\/modules\") Nothing@

If our current directory was @\/tmp@ and we wanted to load the module
@Foo@ located in the file @\/tmp\/Foo.obj@ we would write:

@loadModule \"Foo\" Nothing (Just \"obj\")@

If it cannot load the object it will throw an exception.

{-|

Load a module given its full path and maybe a base directory to use in
figuring out the module's hierarchical name. If no base directory is
given, it is set to the current directory.

For instance if one wants to load module @Foo.Bar@ located in
@\/usr\/modules\/Foo\/Bar.o@ one would issue the command:

@loadModuleFromPath \"\/usr\/modules\/Foo\/Bar.o\" (Just
\"\/usr\/modules\")@

If it cannot load the object it will throw an exception.

{-|

Load a GHC package such as \"base\" or \"text\". Takes the package name,
maybe a path to the packages, maybe a package prefix and maybe a
package suffix.

Path defaults to the current directory, package prefix to \"HS\" and
package suffix to \"o\".

This function also loads accompanying cbits-packages. I.e. if you load
the package @base@ located in @\/usr\/modules@ using @HS@ and @o@ as
prefix and suffix, @loadPackage@ will also look for the file
@\/usr\/modules\/HSbase_cbits.o@ and load it if present.

If it fails to load a package it will throw an exception. You will
need to resolve functions before you use any functions loaded.

Load a GHC package such as \"base\" or \"text\". Takes the full path to
the package.

This function also loads accompanying cbits-packages. I.e. if you load
the package @\/usr\/modules\/HSbase.o@ it will deduce that @o@ is the
suffix and @loadPackageFromPath@ will then also look for the file
@\/usr\/modules\/HSbase_cbits.o@ and load it if present.

Load a function from package (or module) given the fully qualified
name (e.g. @Data.FiniteMap.emptyFM@). If the function can't be found an
exception will be thrown. You should have called @resolveFunctions@
before you call this.

You must take care that you load the function qualified with the name
of the module it's defined in! You can for instance not load
@Data.Bool.not@ because it is only reexported in that module (from
GHC.Base).
